# Some thoughts on making replacement thermistors

## Initial poking at it...

Screw in type thermistors on the `WanHao Duplicator i3 v2.1 \ PowerSpec Duplicator i3 v2.1 \ Maker Select i3 v2 ` aren't dirt cheap, nor terribly expensive. But I was curious about the construction.

Poked around on AliExpress, found these guys: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10Pcs-3D-Printer-Thermocouple-Fixing-Screws-M3-M4-Screw-thread-Temperature-Sensor-Thermistor-K-type-Model/32810517573.htm 

And ordered some of these guys: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/5pcs-lot-100K-ohm-NTC-3950-Thermistors-with-dupont-head-for-3D-Printer-Reprap-Mend-Free/32363061775.html

Perfect. They looked familiar. Ordered anyway.


## So, turns out....

Turns out, the "screw in" portion of the thermistor is a run of a mill, generic, brass M3 standoff. Literally something you can purchase by the pound like common bolts.

Poked around eBay and found: (https://www.ebay.com/itm/321341736569)

So, to affix the thermistor inside the M3 threaded portion, it needs to be glued / epoxied. Since we're dealing with temperatures that can be in excess of 250C, it starts to get a bit dicier to set this up. JB Weld for example is only really good up to 200C.


## Really. Really. REALLY. HOT GLUES.

Here's a few candidates for a high temp epoxy, detail this more later:

I'd think you'd want to shrink wrap it too. Found some nice high shrink rate, high temperature wrap: (https://www.mcmaster.com/#heat-shrink-tubing/=1af28od)
