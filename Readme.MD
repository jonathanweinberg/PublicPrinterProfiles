# Printer Configs

This is a copy of the configuration for Marlin 1.1.5 that I am currently using for my `WanHao \ PowerSpec \ Maker Select i3`.

There is no guarantee on this working well, or safely for you. I take no part in any liability, nor do I claim any stake in the [Marlin project](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

#### You will want to take a look primarily at changes in:

* [Configuration.h](PowerSpec-WanHao_i3/Marlin-1.1.5_Release/Marlin/Configuration.h)

* [Configuration_adv.h](/PublicPrinterProfiles/PowerSpec-WanHao_i3/Marlin-1.1.5_Release/Marlin/Configuration_adv.h)

##### *DO NOT JUST BLINDLY USE THIS WITH A BLTouch. Your Z Probe Offset is likely different.*
